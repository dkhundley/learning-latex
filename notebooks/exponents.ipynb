    "## What's with all these symbols?\n",
    "One of the big turnoffs of math is that it uses a lot of different funky looking symbols. It can literally look like reading a different language, but the reason we have all these symbols is because **mathematical symbols are essentially writing shorthand for larger concepts**. Consider this basic addition problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "1 + 2 = 3\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were to write this in plain English language, it would read as \"one added to two equals three\" or \"one plus two equals three.\" That's not too bad, but now let's consider this more complex little piece of math:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\sum_{n=1}^{10}2x + 3\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Now this is a little more difficult to write out as plain English! If I were to try, it would look something like this: \"For every number between 1 and 10, multiply that number by 2 and then add 3 to it, then take all those numbers and add them together.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can imagine, math gets even more complex than this, so throughout history, mathematicians have created this special notation to help make math easier to read. Unfortunately, this gets lots on most people as, understandably, this can look like a foreign language if you're unfamiliar with this kind of notation. (By the way, that thing that looks like a weird letter \"E\" in the last example is the Greek letter \"sigma\" in its capitalized form, which is always used to represent a sum of values.)"
